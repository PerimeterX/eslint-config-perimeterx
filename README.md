# [PerimeterX](http://www.perimeterx.com) base eslint configuration

## Motivation
While [`eslint:recommended`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/conf/eslint-recommended.js) gives a pretty good baseline, there are some cases we want to keep things more strict.  
Instead of rewriting a new set of rules for each project, we wanted to create a unified set of rules that we can use when we start a new JS project.
